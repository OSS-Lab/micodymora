'''
All rate function classes must comply to the same interface:
- having their actual rate computation function taking the concentration vector
  as first argument and the system's temperature as second argument
- having their rate computation function overloaded on the class' __call__
- being initialized with the following arguments (in this order):
- - the list of the name of the chemical species in the expanded concentration
  vector, in the same order
- - the MetabolicReaction instance they belong to.
- - the rate function's parameters dictionary.
'''

# design note: it is expected that the `reaction` argument is not known at the
# moment of the instanciation of a rate instance, because the rate instance
# itself is a component of a MetabolicReaction instance. It will then be
# initialized as None during the "normal" instanciation of Rate. This attribute
# is later automatically set during MetabolicReaction's instanciation.
# It is kept as an argument in rate classes initialization because:
# - it makes all attributes of the rate class visible in __init__
# - it allows special instanciations (like instances copies etc)
